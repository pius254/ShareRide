                                    <p>ShareRide was started in 2017 by Pius Muriithi.</p>
                                    <p>One day, he was extremly busy at the office and hence he ended up getting out of the office very late - at around 11PM. That night it was raining. Arriving at the bus station, he was all alone and there were no buses. He stayed there for half an hour stranded of how to commute home. Unfortunately, he was attacked and injured. Furthermore, his laptop and other things where stolen. After this act, he desided to find a way to curb the inconviniences associated with public transport and the risks associated with travelling late at night by coming up with a better and a reliable way to commute - SHareRide.</p>
